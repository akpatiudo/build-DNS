### Overview
This lab will help you understand DNS (Domain Name System) by experimenting with A Records, DNS Cache, and CNAME Records. You will create DNS records, observe their behavior, and flush the cache when changes are made.

### Lab Environment
-  Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines
-  DC-1 (Domain Controller, DNS Server) same we used in our pravious lab
-  Client-1 (Joined to the Domain)
-  Remote Desktop Connection (RDP)
-  Windows 11 (21H2)

###  Prerequisites
-  Active Directory (AD) Virtual Machine (DC-1)
-  Client Machine (Client-1) joined to the domain
-  Administrator access to DC-1 and Client-1

### **Lab Steps**
Step 1: Start the Virtual Machines
-  Log into Azure Portal.
-  Navigate to Virtual Machines and start:
-  DC-1 (Domain Controller)
-  Client-1 (Workstation)
RDP into DC-1 as a Domain Admin (mydomain.com\kane_admin).
RDP into Client-1 as an Admin (mydomain.com\adminuser).

###  Exercise 1: Understanding A Records
-  Check DNS Resolution Before Creating an A Record
-  On Client-1, open Command Prompt (cmd).
-  Try to ping mainframe by running:
-  ping mainframe
❌ It should fail because mainframe does not exist in DNS.

### Create A Record for "mainframe"
-  On DC-1, open Server Manager.
-  Click Tools → Select DNS.
-  Expand DC-1 → Expand Forward Lookup Zones → Click your domain (mydomain.com).
-  Right-click in the right panel → Select New Host (A or AAAA).
-  Enter:
-  Name: mainframe
-  IP Address: (Use DC-1’s private IP, e.g., 10.0.1.4)
-  Click Add Host → OK → Done.

### Test DNS Resolution On Client-1
On Client-1, open Command Prompt (cmd).
-  ping mainframe
It should now reply from 10.0.1.4.

### Exercise 2: Observing Local DNS Cache
-  Change the A Record of "mainframe"
-  On DC-1, go back to the DNS Manager.
-  Find "mainframe" in Forward Lookup Zones → Right-click Properties  → Edit.
-  Change its IP Address to 8.8.8.8.
-  Click OK → Close DNS Manager.
 -  check the DNS Cache on Client-1
-  On Client-1, open Command Prompt.
Run:
ping mainframe
❌ It still pings the old IP (10.0.1.4) instead of 8.8.8.8

-  Check the DNS cache:
  -  ipconfig /displaydns
Observe that mainframe is still cached.
-  Flush the DNS Cache
-  On Client-1, run:
-  ipconfig /flushdns
  the is clears the cache.

Try pinging again:
-  ping mainframe
  It should now resolve to 8.8.8.8.

###  Exercise 3: Configuring a CNAME Record
-  Create a CNAME Record for "search"
-  On DC-1, open DNS Manager.
-  Expand Forward Lookup Zones → Click your domain (mydomain.com).
-  Right-click in the right panel → New Alias (CNAME).
-  Enter:
-  Alias Name: search
-  Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN): www.google.com
-  Click OK → Done.

Test the CNAME Record on Client-1
On Client-1, open Command Prompt.
-  Try to ping search:
-  ping search
  -  it may not work, because www.google.com blocks ICMP (ping).
Use nslookup search

### Conclusion
In this lab, we successfully: ✅ Created an A Record (mainframe) and observed its resolution.
✅ Examined the DNS cache, changed a record, and flushed the cache.
✅ Created a CNAME Record (search → www.google.com) and tested it.
